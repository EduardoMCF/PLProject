# Genetic Algorithm - Prolog Implementation

## Pre-installation
Before playing, is requires the swi-prolog version 7.6.x. You may find how install a useful version [here](http://www.swi-prolog.org/build/PPA.html).

## Running

To execute the GA execute the command:
```
swipl Main.pl
```
And then, input the maze size (odd number).

This code uses plenty of recursion, so go get some borrowed memory for the stack.
